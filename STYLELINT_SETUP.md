# Stylelint Setup Complete ✅

## What Happened?

You installed `stylelint` and `stylelint-config-standard` which started showing errors in your `globals.css` file. The errors were related to **OKLCH color format** used by Tailwind CSS 4.

### The Problem

Stylelint's `lightness-notation` rule was complaining about OKLCH color values:

- ❌ `oklch(1 0 0)` - Stylelint wanted this
- ✅ `oklch(100% 0 0)` - But this is what Tailwind CSS 4 generates

The decimal notation (0-1) is **perfectly valid CSS** and is what modern Tailwind CSS uses, but stylelint's strict rules prefer percentage notation.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Stylelint Configuration** (`.stylelintrc.json`)

Added rules to disable problematic checks for Tailwind CSS 4:

```json
{
  "extends": ["stylelint-config-standard"],
  "rules": {
    "lightness-notation": null, // ✅ Allows decimal notation for OKLCH
    "color-function-notation": null, // ✅ Flexible color function format
    "alpha-value-notation": null, // ✅ Allows both number and percentage
    "hue-degree-notation": null // ✅ Flexible hue notation
    // ... Tailwind-specific rules
  }
}
```

### 2. **Stylelint Ignore File** (`.stylelintignore`)

Created to exclude build outputs and dependencies from linting.

### 3. **Package.json Script**

Added a new script to run stylelint:

```json
"lint:css": "stylelint \"**/*.css\" --fix"
```

## How to Use

### Run Stylelint

```bash
pnpm lint:css
```

This will:

- Check all CSS files in your project
- Automatically fix fixable issues
- Report any remaining problems

### VS Code Integration

If VS Code is still showing errors:

1. **Reload VS Code Window**:

   - Press `Cmd+Shift+P`
   - Type "Reload Window"
   - Press Enter

2. **Check VS Code Extension**:

   - Make sure you have the official Stylelint extension installed
   - Extension ID: `stylelint.vscode-stylelint`

3. **Restart VS Code** if needed

## What's Now Allowed

Your `globals.css` can now use:

- ✅ OKLCH colors with decimal lightness: `oklch(0.5 0.2 180)`
- ✅ Tailwind's `@theme` directive
- ✅ Custom variants: `@custom-variant dark`
- ✅ Tailwind's `@apply`, `@layer`, etc.
- ✅ Modern CSS features

## Why This Matters

Tailwind CSS 4 uses:

- **OKLCH color space** for better color perception
- **Decimal notation** (0-1) which is valid CSS
- **Modern CSS features** that older linters might not recognize

The configuration ensures stylelint works **with** Tailwind CSS 4, not against it.

## Next Steps

✅ Configuration is complete!
✅ Command-line linting works perfectly
⏳ VS Code might need a reload to pick up changes

If you still see errors in VS Code:

1. Reload the window (`Cmd+Shift+P` → "Reload Window")
2. Check that the Stylelint extension is installed and enabled
3. Restart VS Code completely if needed

The errors are **configuration-related**, not actual problems with your CSS!
